How do I approach designing software?

Working on this project helped me further develop my ability to break down complex scenes into manageable design components. I began with a reference image and focused on how to recreate the scene using basic 3D shapes, lighting, textures, and transformations. One design skill I strengthened was the use of abstraction—identifying repeated patterns and creating reusable logic to manage transformations and lighting setup.

My design process was iterative: I sketched out the object layout, translated it into 3D space, and adjusted placements through testing. I also mapped each texture and lighting source purposefully to simulate realism and visual balance. These tactics will apply to future work, particularly when planning interactive graphics or game environments where visual clarity and structured hierarchy are critical.
How do I approach developing programs?

This 3D scene pushed me to apply new strategies in OpenGL development. I used modular classes like ShaderManager, SceneManager, and ViewManager to organize code more effectively. One new tactic was using shader uniforms to pass lighting and camera data in real time, which gave me more flexibility in controlling the rendering.

Iteration played a major role. Many features (like camera controls, texture mapping, and directional lights) were developed, tested, and improved over multiple versions. I also created fallback versions of my code to avoid losing progress after making changes.

Over the course of the project, my approach to development evolved from writing linear OpenGL code to developing a reusable, object-oriented scene management system. This not only made my code more scalable but also made debugging and feature testing easier during the final stages of the project.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Working with computational graphics has deepened my understanding of how math, code, and design converge to create visual experiences. These skills are directly applicable to my goals in computer science and data visualization, where visual clarity and responsiveness matter.

In my future educational pathway, I can leverage my OpenGL knowledge when studying simulations, physics-based rendering, or game development. I now understand how the rendering pipeline works, from vertex transformations to fragment shading.

Professionally, these graphics and visualization skills help me stand out in areas like user interface development, data science, and software engineering. The ability to present data or environments visually is a valuable skill in many fields—from building dashboards to creating 3D simulations or educational tools.
